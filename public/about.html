<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Bianca, a graduate of Tourism Management and a Bachelor's Degree Holder. Looking back,
  I do not have any interest at all in terms of programming or specifically, in being a web developer. In
  fact, just thinking about it makes my head spin (most especially when I see those IT guys in movies). But
  oh well, time changed as well as my passion. And now, I'm saying hello to this new phase of mine, which I'm
  really really grateful for; definitely glad of pursuing this path. XOXO
</p>
